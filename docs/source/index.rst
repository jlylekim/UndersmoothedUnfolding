UndersmoothedUnfolding
==================================================
``UndersmoothedUnfolding`` provides a `ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/>`_ implementation
of an unfolding technique which aims at optimal *uncertainty quantification* for the unfolded particle spectrum. The implementation is an extension of the `TUnfold <http://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html>`_ library and can hence be easily incorporated into existing TUnfold-based particle physics data analyses.
