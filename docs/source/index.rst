UndersmoothedUnfolding
==================================================
``UndersmoothedUnfolding`` provides a `ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/>`_ implementation
of an unfolding technique that aims at optimal *uncertainty quantification* for an unfolded particle spectrum. The implementation is an extension of the `TUnfold <http://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html>`_ library and can hence be easily incorporated into existing TUnfold-based particle physics data analyses. This website provides the documentation for using and installing ``UndersmoothedUnfolding`` which can be downloaded by cloning `this <https://github.com/jlylekim/UndersmoothedUnfolding>`_ Git repository.
