UndersmoothedUnfolding API

TODO:
* autodoc only works with Python
* If I want (automated) documentation, need to use Breathe (Breathe provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen documentation systems.)
* To do so, need to learn Doxygen as well
* Might be better to manually write API as we have 2 functions
* Discuss with Mikael
* Actually maybe I can use Jupyter notebook
